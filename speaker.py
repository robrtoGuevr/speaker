texto = "This article is about the book by Stephen King. For the television series based on the book, see 11.22.63. For the date, see November 1963 § November 22, 1963 (Friday). For other uses, see 11-22-63. 11/22/63 is a novel by Stephen King about a time traveller who attempts to prevent the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, which occurred on November 22, 1963 (the novel's titular date).[1][2] It is the 60th book published by Stephen King, his 49th novel and the 42nd under his own name. The novel was announced on King's official site on March 2, 2011.[3] A short excerpt was released online on June 1, 2011,[4] and another excerpt was published in the October 28, 2011, issue of Entertainment Weekly.[5] The novel was published on November 8, 2011[6] and quickly became a number-one bestseller. It stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for 16 weeks.[7] 11/22/63 won the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Best Mystery/Thriller and the 2012 International Thriller Writers Award for Best Novel,[8][9] and was nominated for the 2012 British Fantasy Award for Best Novel[10] and the 2012 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[11] The novel required considerable research to accurately portray the late 1950s and early 1960s.[12] King commented on the amount of research it required, saying I've never tried to write anything like this before. It was really strange at first, like breaking in a new pair of shoes.[12] The novel was adapted into a Hulu television series in 2016, 11.22.63."
